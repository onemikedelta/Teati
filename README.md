 Simple tool to be sure your friend is really 'your' friend
 
 You should set an encryption key before using and periodically change it.
 You need to build two copies with the same key and give one of them to your friend. Next time you are going to make a contact with your friend,
 Type something into serial console using only letters and numbers. For example: "4c9gha" Read that text to your friend and s/he should type it in device.
 Then s/he should read back the following line to you, don't have to read all of them just 4-5 digits is enough if you are paranoid read more.
 At this point you check if it matchs and you are sure that your friend is the right person that you think. Then you should read the following line to your friend and your friend now knows it is you.
 
 Similar mechanisms are using in internet authentication systems, named "challenge-response authentication".
 This is basic and human readable example.
 
 This software is not fully tested, use it at your own risk.
